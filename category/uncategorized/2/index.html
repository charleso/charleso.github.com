My introduction to Clearcase began about two years again at my now current
current job. Coming from SVN it seemed, and still is, so overly complicated and
slow. What is this "config spec" you speak of? Anyway, I could write essays
devoted to my loathing of Clearcase but this is not what this is about.
<br /><br />
I've been tempted for quite some time to introduce a DVCS, <span>any</span>
DVCS, into the mix to make my life easier. However, I was concerned it may end
up being just as much work as just sticking with Clearcase. I certainly didn't
want to have to stuff around with manually deleting and adding files and native
moving/renaming was also essential.
<br /><br />
I found some<a href="http://genaud.net/2008/08/clearcase-globally-git-locally/"> helpful scripts</a>,
but nothing that really <span>just worked</span>.
<br /><br />
Anyway, I finally got my act together and put together a simple bridge which
can push and pull changes into Git. About bloody time!
<br /><br />
<a href="http://github.com/charleso/git-cc/tree/master">http://github.com/charleso/git-cc/tree/master</a>
<br /><br />
The README is probably a good place to start for anyone interested.
<br /><br />
<span>Please note:</span> It's still very much a work in progress. However, I'm
already using it at work to much joy and relief. Not more pointless checking
out on private branches. No more VOB locking or stupid branch renaming for
releases. Just sweet, sweet Gitness.
<br /><br />
A few basic examples:
<br />
<pre>
    python gitcc.py init
    d:\views\your_clearcase_view
    python gitcc.py rebase
    # Obligatory comment about getting coffee and doing work
    python gitcc.py checkin
</pre>
That's about it really. I'm interested to see if anyone else finds this
useful or has any suggestions.
<br /><br />
Finally, it was so refreshing to finally work with Python again. I'd forgotten
how simple and concise it is to use. I'm so entrenched in Java that, like an
addiction, it's too easy to fall back on. That's not to say I'm addicted to
Java, nor do I hate it particularly, but it's just so comfortable and I just
don't have to think about it anymore. Sad really.

<a href="http://selenium-ide.openqa.org/selenium-ide.gif"><img src="http://selenium-ide.openqa.org/selenium-ide.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a>
A few weeks ago I investigated Flex automated testing to determine it's
feasibility for our new Flex project. On Wednesday my boss has asked me to
follow through with that original investigation and get it up-and-running on
our build loop ASAP.
<br /><br />
The tools I originally looked at:<br />
<ol>
<li>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_QuickTest_Professional">HP QuickTest Professional</a> or QTP. 
This is the big daddy of Flex automation testing, and
costs an arm and a leg. The funny thing is I couldn't seem to get this working
last time. That and it looks like an old Windows 95 app (superficial I
know).
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://riatest.com/">RIATest</a>. In many ways
this is the nicest of the tools. Quick, simple and it just works (TM). However
it's in very early stages, has its own IDE/language and only works on
Windows.
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/tester/functional/">Rational Functional Tester</a> or RFT,
a set of Rational plugins for Eclipse. The business preferred option as we use this for other products as well.
<br />
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/">Custom Automated Agents</a>, the adobe sample for automation testing. It's worth
noting that all the above products are essentially just rebadged versions of
this. This has the most power of all these tools, but is very bare bones and
quite complicated to understand.
<br />
</li>
</ol>
Originally I had decided on RFT a few weeks ago and wrote some basic tests.
However, today I spent some more time with it and ran into a few snags.
<br /><br />
Firstly our toolbar is a Flex MenuBar, which (for some <span>stupid</span>
reason) doesn't handle ItemClick events for root items. Without this you can't
perform the simplest of actions like searching. To get this working we would
<span>have</span> to use something else. Strike one.
<br /><br />
Secondly the Grid data verification points were now returning blanks in every
cell. After some snooping it turns out setting a custom itemRenderer for
columns (ie combobox or checkbox) causes this to happen. Sadly we need to do
this and I couldn't seem to fix the problem. Strike two.
<br /><br />
While none of these are show stoppers it made me realise I really didn't like
using RFT, it felt flaky, so I thought I'd better re-examine my options.
<br /><br />
The other, as of yet unexplored option, was <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a>. 
Just the other day (literally) the<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/seleniumflexapi/"> new flex API</a>
was released. Behind the scenes this is simply an exposed API via the Flex 
<a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/external/ExternalInterface.html">ExternalInterface</a>
(basically a Flex/Javascript bridge). As I was looking at this I realised we
could just expose our own custom API to compliment Selenium's.
<br /><br />
For some reason this latest option appeals to me as it potentially grants the
most power and least amount of headaches. Using the above tools feels like
we're getting locked into a specific way of using Flex. When something doesn't
work, like it did today, there isn't much we can do except change
<span>our</span> application to fit the required mold. Instead it would be nice
if the automated tools were as <span>flex</span>ible as we need them to be.
<br /><br />
What we loose is the recording capability, which I don't think is a huge loss
(but sad). Some of our other functional tests at work are also written by hand.
It will also require some more initial tweaking while we flesh out our own
internal API. My other concern is that it's not <span>exactly</span> the same
as users interacting with the app, but then again neither are the above tools.
<br /><br />
I'm still not sure at this stage which option I'm going to settle on. Time is
of the essence, and I really need to have something to show by next week. I'm
hoping with some more testing tomorrow, Selenium will be just what the doctor
ordered.

I used to write a private WordPress blog and I was contemplating mapping
it to my shiny new domain to kick it off.
<br /><br />
However the following comparison clearly shows why I switched to Blogger instead:
<br /><br />
Wordpress - <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/domain-mapping-registration/">$10/year</a>
<br />
Blogger - Free
<br /><br />
It's that simple. Yes, I'm cheap.
