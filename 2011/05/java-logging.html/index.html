This is a fairly short post about my brief experiences with logging in Java. I
realise it's 2011 and logging is very unsexy, but I thought I'd share anyway.
<br /><br />
Let me just say this straight-up - Java Logging you are <i>completely fucking
useless</i>.  It boggles the mind how badly Sun screwed up the implementation
of something so simple but yet so fundamental. It's logging for Christ's sake;
how hard can it be?!? 
<a href="http://www.bileblog.org/2003/10/javautillogging-shoddiness/">This</a>
captures the essence of my feelings, so I'll leave it at that.
<br /><br />
One thing I <i>did</i> want to mention is
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a> and the awesome
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#SiftingAppender">SiftingAppender</a>.
Logback is the successor to the much loved 
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J</a>, written by the same dude and
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/reasonsToSwitch.html">addressing</a> some of the
problems with the original. 
<br /><br />
My manager wanted a way for our users to enable <i>individual</i> logging on
the server and not require any meddling on the server by an administrator. A
quick Google revealed
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/840465/have-you-seen-an-appender-that-would-log-to-separate-files-based-on-ndc-in-log4j/925978#925978">this</a>
and from there it wasn't hard to implement a start/stop trace button on each
page which harnesses
<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/MDC.html">MDC</a> for per-user
logging. On completion the trace can either be downloaded or emailed directly
from the server to the system administrator or bug tracker.
<br /><br />
Honestly, if/when I ever work on another online application I will almost
certainly re-implement something very similar again. Being able to capture a
trace of everything from the server for a single user session has proven to be
an invaluable tool for diagnosing bugs. Give it a whirl!
