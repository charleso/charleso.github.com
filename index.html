  <div class="document">
<p>Apart from complaining about Clearcase I have actually done some real work the
past few years.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: How we converted our entire COBOL code-base to Java (sort-of).</p>
<p><em>Already you might start to feel a sick feeling in the back of your throat.
That's normal and should pass shortly after you finish reading.</em></p>
<p>COBOL? WTF?!? This is usually the first thing people say to me when I tell them
about what I've been working on. I'm sad to say that COBOL is still very much
in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL#Legacy">use</a>.</p>
<p>The dilemma that our company faced was that our main product has been around for
many years and over time we have built up a unbelievably large code-base of COBOL,
consisting of millions of lines. Re-writing this is both costly and
time-consuming, not to mention risky. We needed another option.</p>
<p>Another serious problem is that the upfront cost of CICS, the COBOL
'application server' if you will, running on dedicated Mainframe hardware,
<em>plus</em> the cost of Micro Focus licenses, for compiling COBOL, is <em>bloody</em>
expensive. If we could run on a 100% Java stack, using open source technologies,
we could save ourselves, and our customers, cold, hard cash.</p>
<p>At this point I need to mention something 'special' about how we use COBOL. To
support a wide-range of transaction systems and databases we developed a custom
variation of the language, which included custom-built 'macros' which generate
unique code depending on the environment. While not
especially relevant to this article, this leads to larger-than-expected COBOL
(which is large enough as it is). The size of the program is significant for a
few reasons, which I'll discuss below.</p>
<p>Initially we started with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legacyj.com/">LegacyJ</a>, a commercial product that
advertised productive COBOL to Java conversion. What was nice about using
LegacyJ was that we quickly discovered that it was, in fact, possible to
convert our code successfully and have a running system. However, we ran into
a few serious problems that made us hesitate.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Java generated by LegacyJ was quite lengthy and often
didn't compile due to the length of some methods and number of fields.
Apparently Java has a <a class="reference external" href="href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html#88659">limit</a>, not that you would ever conceivably reach it. To
work around this I had to re-parse the Java to break these methods into smaller
chunks and introduce a hierarchy of classes to work-around the field limit.
Yuck.</p>
<p>Secondly, the classes generated by LegacyJ didn't separate the idea of 'meta'
information such as variable types from runtime data. For each instance of a
program, variables had effectively duplicate copies of type information,
resulting in an extra-large memory footprint.</p>
<p>The other issue, and perhaps the most compelling, was that of money; LegacyJ
was not cheap. We were trading one expensive platform, CICS, with another.</p>
<p>At the same time the following <a class="reference external" href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/07/cobol-to-java">article</a> appeared, introducing an open-source
COBOL to Java converter called <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/naca/">NACA</a>. I tried it almost immediately but quickly
found that many of our COBOL programs didn't compile due to some commands that
NACA hadn't implemented. At first I gave up and went back to our LegacyJ
integration. It was only later, after taking a second look, that I realised
there was much more potential on NACA's generated Java and general approach.</p>
<p>The most obvious was that the Java was actually readable! At least if you <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/naca/source/browse/trunk/NacaSamples/src/online/ONLINE1.java">count</a>
this as readable. NACA actually checked-in their Java files after the
conversion, so the code had to be both readable and maintainable. This
also had the nice side-effect of allowing our absolutely massive generated
COBOL programs to compile (in 99% of cases anyway).</p>
<p>In addition there was a separate and static class structure representing the
program definition, meaning that each program required less memory.</p>
<p>I was given some time to investigate the possibility of making NACA work with
our unique flavour of COBOL. Fortunately it turned out there wasn't too much
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/charleso/naca">missing</a> and I managed to get a working prototype in a reasonably short period
of time. After that the decision to switch to a cheaper and open-source
alternative which we could control wasn't hard to make and we haven't looked
back since.</p>
<p>To avoid making this post longer that it already is I might save the important
discussion of performance for another day. In short our pure-Java application
runs surprisingly quickly. The biggest bottleneck is, without a doubt, one of
memory. Running an entire-COBOL runtime within the JVM is obviously costly in
terms of memory, not helped by our generated COBOL and vast code-base.</p>
<p>Do I recommend this approach to others? <em>Absolutely</em>, without a
doubt. There seems to be <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1029974/experience-migrating-legacy-cobol-pl1-to-java/1061829#1061829">people</a> advising against a direct port, or at least
<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1796906/cobol-migrations-strategies/1810332#1810332">re-thinking</a> the problem first. For us the issue is one of scale. There simply
isn't enough time/money to re-write everything, at least not in this decade. We
needed to do something <em>now</em>; something we could <em>guarantee</em> would continue to
work.</p>
<p>The benefits of running a pure-Java stack are, alone, compelling. One example
that springs to mind is that of tracing. Once upon a time we would need to ask
customers with a bug to recompile specific applications in trace mode in the
vain hope that we actually knew where the problem was. Now we can leverage
powerful Java <a class="reference external" href="http://logback.qos.ch/">logging</a> (no, not that useless java.util.logging) and have full
tracing across the entire stack; something that is invaluable for customer
support.</p>
<p>So, while I hate the idea of granting further life to our hideous COBOL demon,
from a business point-of-view it has been crucial in the continued success and
evolution of our product; giving us breathing room to slowly migrate COBOL
logic to 'normal' Java applications while guaranteeing our business logic
continues to serve our customers. Or at least that's what our marketing
brochures say; for me it was fun.</p>

<p>Inspired by my friend <a class="reference external" href="http://buffered.io/2011/02/15/now-powered-by-blogofile/">OJ</a>, I've decided to make the switch to Blogofile.
I guess I have too much time on my hands.</p>
<p>There isn't much I can say on this subject that hasn't already <a class="reference external" href="http://mike.pirnat.com/2010/12/18/why-i-switched-to-blogofile/">been</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://morgangoose.com/blog/2010/09/28/switching-to-blogofile/">said</a>.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/blob/master/converters/blogger2blogofile.py">This</a> script came in handy to convert my Blogger posts across.</p>
<p>My biggest hurdle was finding a new host <em>and</em> being a complete cheapskate.
I couldn't seem to find a free and simple HTML site. I started to think
about Dropbox, until I realised that they don't respect index.html files.
Fortunately <a class="reference external" href="http://manuel-ohlendorf.de/blog/2010/12/23/hosting-a-blogofile-blog-on-github-with-github-pages/">someone</a> had a neat idea - host it on <a class="reference external" href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>One thing would have been <em>nice</em> is a selection of out-the-box themes;
but completely understandable that there isn't.
In the meantime I ported my current Blogger <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogcrowds.com/resources/blogger-templates/13-565">theme</a>, which was surprisingly
painless.</p>
<p>I'll probably be tweaking bits-and-pieces of the site in the next few weeks,
like a child playing with a new toy. Procrastinating instead of, say,
writing new blog posts.</p>

So, we have a dilemma at work. How do the developers and documentation teams
collaborate on a single set of documentation files while using familiar tools?
Is such a thing possible or am I dreaming?
<br /><br />
Currently the documentation team at our work uses
<a href="http://www.author-it.com/">Author-it</a>, a full-blown authoring
'solution'. For some time we, the developers, were been sent Word documents
which we updated and emailed back. At this point the source control fanatic in
me started to twitch. It's a document - just like source code - can I see who
did what changes? How do two people work on the same document at the same time,
and what about conflicts? Can I have multiple version of the same document? The
other problem was one of cost; Author-it is too expensive to justify individual
licenses for developers.
<br /><br />
We had talked about switching to a more text-based documentation system
on-and-off for some time. Finally I cracked and decided to just do it.
<br /><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">Latex</a> was the first
possibility that surfaced. However, as I thought about it more the idea of
everyone having to learn obtuse Latex syntax before writing a single-line of
documentation was a little off-putting. Note: I really do like Latex, but I
felt like it might have been overly complicated for our situation.
<br /><br />
The second alternative was to use a publication
<a href="http://www.dclab.com/dita_docbook.asp">format</a> like
<a href="http://www.docbook.org/">Docbook</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture">DITA</a>.
While certainly a powerful way to group content, the prospect of living in XML
hell didn't enthuse me all that much. I already get enough of that in Java-land
thank you very much.
<br /><br />
My final option was to use a lightweight markup langague, like
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> or
<a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructureText</a> (ReST),
which GitHub actively promotes for their README files. This felt like the right
fit for us, and without further consultation I converted our current internal
word documents to ReST, added them to Git and created a Jenkin job to output
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/">PDF</a> and HTML files. Bam!
<br /><br />
At this point us developers were happy again. We were back to using our
favourite source control for collaboration, without have to stuff around with
emailing Word documents. We could quickly edit text files, use source control
to track/merge changes and didn't have to worry any more about niggling
presentation issues. My manager, on the other hand, who was away at the time,
was <i>not</i> so pleased. (I swear this had nothing to do with the timing of
my rash decision).
<br /><br />
For us developers the idea of using a text editor to edit a document is a
fairly comfortable one. For people used to - and who enjoy using - Word this
was in some ways a big step backwards. No spell checking, no auto-complete, no
drag 'n' drop. All that good stuff. Another complaint he had was about
presentation - the PDF output wasn't slick enough to be used officially.
Finally, if we wanted to switch to something else, ReST seemed to lack in some
of the more powerful <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.0/archspec/topicover.html">concepts</a>
required to support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_publishing">single-source</a>
publishing.
<br /><br />
I could definitely be wrong but it feels like nothing has quite <i>nailed</i>
this space in the space, at least in the OSS community. What would certainly
help is a powerful and easy to use  editor. Perhaps a plugin for Open Office
would do the trick? Alternatively a browser-based editor, not too unlike
<a href="http://rst.ninjs.org/">this</a>.
<br /><br />
We're currently in a holding pattern at the moment. Developers are still
(happily) using ReST, but the 'official' stuff is being written by the
documentation team. Us and them.
<br /><br />
I see a couple of available options:<br />
<ol>
    <li>What am I talking about, emailing Word documents around is fine - stop complaining.</li>
    <li>Embrace Author-it and see if it can support more collaborators. Just looking at their website briefly it seems like they have an <a href="http://www.author-it.com/index.php?page=reviewer">online</a> review mode.</li>
    <li>Meet my boss half-way, he can live without the nice GUI but we switch to a singe-source markup language like DocBook/DITA.</li>
    <li>Everyone else be damned; developers rule; reStructuredText it is!</li>
</ol>I'm curious what other people have done in similar situations.<br />

This is a fairly short post about my brief experiences with logging in Java. I
realise it's 2011 and logging is very unsexy, but I thought I'd share anyway.
<br /><br />
Let me just say this straight-up - Java Logging you are <i>completely fucking
useless</i>.  It boggles the mind how badly Sun screwed up the implementation
of something so simple but yet so fundamental. It's logging for Christ's sake;
how hard can it be?!? 
<a href="http://www.bileblog.org/2003/10/javautillogging-shoddiness/">This</a>
captures the essence of my feelings, so I'll leave it at that.
<br /><br />
One thing I <i>did</i> want to mention is
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a> and the awesome
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#SiftingAppender">SiftingAppender</a>.
Logback is the successor to the much loved 
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J</a>, written by the same dude and
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/reasonsToSwitch.html">addressing</a> some of the
problems with the original. 
<br /><br />
My manager wanted a way for our users to enable <i>individual</i> logging on
the server and not require any meddling on the server by an administrator. A
quick Google revealed
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/840465/have-you-seen-an-appender-that-would-log-to-separate-files-based-on-ndc-in-log4j/925978#925978">this</a>
and from there it wasn't hard to implement a start/stop trace button on each
page which harnesses
<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/MDC.html">MDC</a> for per-user
logging. On completion the trace can either be downloaded or emailed directly
from the server to the system administrator or bug tracker.
<br /><br />
Honestly, if/when I ever work on another online application I will almost
certainly re-implement something very similar again. Being able to capture a
trace of everything from the server for a single user session has proven to be
an invaluable tool for diagnosing bugs. Give it a whirl!
