My introduction to Clearcase began about two years again at my now current
current job. Coming from SVN it seemed, and still is, so overly complicated and
slow. What is this "config spec" you speak of? Anyway, I could write essays
devoted to my loathing of Clearcase but this is not what this is about.
<br /><br />
I've been tempted for quite some time to introduce a DVCS, <span>any</span>
DVCS, into the mix to make my life easier. However, I was concerned it may end
up being just as much work as just sticking with Clearcase. I certainly didn't
want to have to stuff around with manually deleting and adding files and native
moving/renaming was also essential.
<br /><br />
I found some<a href="http://genaud.net/2008/08/clearcase-globally-git-locally/"> helpful scripts</a>,
but nothing that really <span>just worked</span>.
<br /><br />
Anyway, I finally got my act together and put together a simple bridge which
can push and pull changes into Git. About bloody time!
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The README is probably a good place to start for anyone interested.
<br /><br />
<span>Please note:</span> It's still very much a work in progress. However, I'm
already using it at work to much joy and relief. Not more pointless checking
out on private branches. No more VOB locking or stupid branch renaming for
releases. Just sweet, sweet Gitness.
<br /><br />
A few basic examples:
<br />
<pre>
    python gitcc.py init
    d:\views\your_clearcase_view
    python gitcc.py rebase
    # Obligatory comment about getting coffee and doing work
    python gitcc.py checkin
</pre>
That's about it really. I'm interested to see if anyone else finds this
useful or has any suggestions.
<br /><br />
Finally, it was so refreshing to finally work with Python again. I'd forgotten
how simple and concise it is to use. I'm so entrenched in Java that, like an
addiction, it's too easy to fall back on. That's not to say I'm addicted to
Java, nor do I hate it particularly, but it's just so comfortable and I just
don't have to think about it anymore. Sad really.
