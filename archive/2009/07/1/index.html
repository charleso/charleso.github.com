So it's been almost a year since my last post and I obviously haven't had much
to say. I'm back to talk about the exact same thing, again. I really need to
find something other than version control to obsess about...
<br /><br />
Recently I made the switch to Ubuntu at work. This left me without ClearCase,
as it <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=984&uid=swg21239315">requires</a>
some derivative of enterprise Redhat or SUSE, which didn't interest me in the
slightest. I can only assume this is partially due to the complexities of
managing a separate binary kernel module required by MVFS, their virtual
filesystem. As an alternative Rational seem to be pushing their 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/05/0809_CCDemo/">Java implementation</a> 
ClearCase Remote Client (CCRC). CCRC is essentially an Eclipse plugin
communicating to a server - via a mixture of Web Services and RPC, which in
turn has the 'real' client installed. As you would expect this seems to have
some performance trade-offs, and it also feels to me quite unstable at the
moment, often throwing strange errors unrelated to ClearCase.
It's certainly better than nothing though.
<br /><br />
This, of course, raised immediate problems for me as I refuse to go back to
using ClearCase directly now that I've tasted the good (and fast) Git life.
Because I obviously can't seem to help myself I 
<a href="http://github.com/charleso/gitcc4j/tree/master">ported</a> the gitcc to
Java to use their new libraries, although it's <span>definitely</span> the last
time.
<br /><br />
One good thing to come out of this new version is the cross-platform ability to
login as any user, bypassing the domain-specific authentication that is
normally used. At least in my situation ClearCase was authenticated via our
Windows domain and I could see no quick and safe way to switch between users.
This was/is essential for us to preserve the identity of the author of each
commit in ClearCase. I strongly suspect there is a way around this, but for the
life of me I couldn't think of any. The one alternative that occured to me
would have been to run gitcc on something other than Windows configured with
NFS and 'sudo su' to each user as required. For reasons I am unable to
articulate I wasn't all that happy with the idea and never bothered.
<br /><br />
I've been running a gitcc daemon at work for the past week with great success.
It's funny how the speed difference of pushing/pulling affects your work
habits. Before I used to watch the checkin and rebase console output, like
being glued to TV. Especially because we're using UCM this could take up to a
few minutes to do it's rebase/deliver business, which would distract me and I
would often 'hold off' on pushing or pulling because I wanted to do it all in
one hit to save time. I no longer have that problem, being able to 'fetch'
whenever I like, knowing it only takes (literally) a second to complete. Of
course in the background the daemon is chugging away, syncing with ClearCase at
its own slow-and-steady pace.
<br /><br />
Git seems to be finally taking off at work, after a slow and bumpy start.
Personally I'm thrilled to be using Git at work regardless of what anyone else
is doing. However some part of me isn't satisfied with just stopping there. It
pains me to see others at work using a sub-par tool when I know there is a much
better one available. The worst part is that most of them don't even know what
they're missing, having never used anything else. Having originally come from
SVN I couldn't bear to have to checkout files every time I wanted to make a
change and I knew it didn't have to be that way. A co-worker even commented
that they 'like' knowing when they're modifying files just in case they
accidentally typed something without realising it. That may be true, but I
strongly suspect after using Git for a few days they would be unlikely to
revert. That's not even taking into consideration the many other benefits of
using a DVCS - like local branching.
<br /><br />
What remains is the biggest hurdle: taking it to the 'next level'. A handful of
developers are currently using it individually, but now that we have daemon
available we can start to look at essentially ditching ClearCase, at least for
our team. Part of the problem with working for a 'largish' company is their
slow and cautious approach when introducing new technologies. From their
perspective they have to consider what happens if I get run over by a bus
tomorrow (those damn buses - always threatening to run us over). No one else
really has the same intimate knowledge of gitcc and its inner workings. How
much time and money would be wasted having to fix it, or revert to ClearCase if
I was no longer there? The other issue is one of training and expertise. Now
you have the problem of supporting <span>two</span> completely different source
control systems, including training for, and maintenance of, both.
<br /><br />
The final problem that I face is one of Git's maturity. I love Git. Without a
doubt it is the most advanced version control system available today. Sure it's
got<span> more</span> than its fair share of warts, but I wouldn't use anything
else (yes I know about Mercurial, and in any other universe without Git I would
be using it quite happily). Unfortunately what it lacks at the moment is all
that boring Windows GUI and administration tools that managers and
non-technical people need (and I don't just mean TortoiseGit). I'm sure they'll
be here soon enough, but in the meantime I would still hesitate if asked 'is
Git ready'.  The problem is that the viable alternative, at this very second in
time, would most likely be SVN, which isn't a <span>bad</span> system, but when
compared to any modern DVCS it looks increasingly archaic. If we switched to
SVN now I strongly suspect there would be pressure to switch (again) to
something more powerful in the not-too-distant future.
<br /><br />
I'd love to use Git at work as our sole version control. Unfortunately as a
developer I don't really have the time or patience to play politics and ensure
that all aspects of a migration are planned for. However, it seems silly to me
that if a majority of your developers start to use an alternative system for
any aspect of work then there isn't some reflection on your current one and how
you can make your working environment that much more productive. I'm not
suggesting for a second that we replace ClearCase tomorrow. Instead I am simply
proposing a gradual adoption, or at least trial, of Git over ClearCase. Hell,
we're pretty much doing that now anyway, just not officially.
<br /><br />
Finally, the other revelation to come out of this is how truly entrenched in
Java I have become. I found with the Python implementation I would often worry
about making changes because I would have to spend part of the time
investigating how to implement something 'in Python' rather than just being
able to focus on the problem at hand. This has nothing to do with Python, it
still remains a fantastic language, but perhaps says something about me getting
older and less adaptable when learning new things. I hope I never reach that
point where I'm too afraid to try something new, although I'm certainly
becoming far less likely to (at least seriously) learn a new language in my
spare time. I'm just hoping one of these days I get to use Haskell at work. :)
